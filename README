README for ufit
===============

ufit is a universal scattering data fitting package for use in
noninteractive scripts.  It handles complex fitting functions by
combining them from pre-defined "model" objects and handling
parameter interdependencies well.

Fitting is done by one of several backends:
* lmfit (L-M leastsq that allows parameter constraints)
* minuit (pyminuit 1 or 2)
* scipy (basic L-M leastsq from scipy.optimize)

Results can be easily plotted and further processed.
