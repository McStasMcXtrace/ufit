README for ufit
===============

ufit is a universal scattering data fitting package for use in
noninteractive scripts, and with a graphical user interface.

It handles complex fitting functions by combining them from
pre-defined "model" objects and handling parameter constraints
and interdependencies well.

Fitting is done by one of several backends:

* lmfit (L-M leastsq that allows parameter constraints)
* minuit (pyminuit 1 or 2)
* scipy (basic L-M leastsq from scipy.optimize)

Results can be easily plotted and further processed.  Plotting
is handled by matplotlib.

The GUI uses PyQt 4.
